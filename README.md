This is Toussaint Gilbert's Social Network API using MONGO DB


# Link to Google Drive video


# Purpose 
The purpose of this assignment is to create API routes to GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE data using a noSQL database aka. Mongo DB. 

# My Experience
I had an EXTREMELY troubling time because I thought there was an error with my code so i kept trying to trouble shoot in vs code but the whole time i was typing in `https` into insomnia instead of `http` which is why  kept getting errors when trying to view the database

# Installation
 Once this repo is cloned run "npm i" in your terminal to get all required dependancies 

# Usage

Run the "npm start" Command in your terminal and open up whatever application you prefer to test backend routes. I personally use insomnia because of school but postman works great as well
